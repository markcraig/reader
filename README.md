# Reader

This is a project to kick the tires on the [Cloud9 IDE](https://c9.io/).

The home page uses the [Google Feed API](https://developers.google.com/feed/v1/)
to read some feeds, and then displays the results as the body of the page.

It sets a cookie when you visit. On the next visit, it displays
only entries that have not already been read.

At present, feeds are stored in the browser's local storage. The app is
completely client side. It would be cool if the feeds could be stored
in a user profile somewhere.

## To do
*   Store feed lists by user somewhere. (OAuth 2.0 enough for this?)
